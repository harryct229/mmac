# Install Ruby

## Linux

  Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu use the apt package manager system. You can use it like this:

    $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1

  Arch Linux uses a package manager named pacman. To get Ruby, just do this:

    $ sudo pacman -S ruby

## Windows

  Use RubyInstaller. Then just use the installer, and you’re done! (The installation file can be found in this folder)

## OSX

  Many people on Mac OS X use Homebrew as a package manager. It’s really easy to get Ruby:

    $ brew install ruby


# Run Program

    $ bundle
    $ cd test/
    $ ruby test.rb
